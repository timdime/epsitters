    <h1>Ruby</h1>
    <p>I am 12 years old and am in 6th grade. I have 3 brothers (7, 4, and 4) and my dog Rosie. In my free time, I like to play softball and draw. I have been babysitting for about 2 years now and I am babysitter safe. I went to a 4-hour class that taught us how to do CPR, Heimlich, and what to do in case of an emergency. I am a social person and I know how to communicate my thoughts and ideas. I can't wait to meet you! - Ruby</p>
